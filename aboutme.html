    <h1>Future Projects</h1>
    <p> My journey as a content creator is still on its baby steps, I know there's a long way ahead, and knowing that there's still a lot more to learn is what motimvates and excites me to keep going on this journey. Currently because of full time collage and full time work, all of my work is directed to one of those things. 
    </p>
<br>
    <p>
    Once I learn enough about all of the tools I need to walk with my own legs, I will start investing and dedicating much more time on my content creation abilities and lauching future projects. Below are some of them:

    <p>Besides my ilustration portifolio, I want to spend more time writting more, in many different senses, whether it's writting short stories, books, screeplays or even just journaling on blogg posts. I want to start putting more content out there and reaching people and provide a positive impact. I want to find my audience and like minded people so I can not only provide but also get more inspiration. Because of that, I plan on finishin writting my books and I plan to find a publisher to help me launch them, it's a long term plan but it something that I am already planning from now. </p>  
<br>

    <p> Last, but not least, I  plan on creating and constantly improve my own website to gather all my multimedia content portifolio. One of the things I plan on doing is to create my own spotify business account and share my horror stories in audio format to reach an new audience and new heights</p>
