        <p> Welcome to my portfolio platform! I'm a 29-year-old full-time multimedia programming and design student hailing from Brazil, currently residing in the vibrant city of New York. By day, I serve as a patient liaison at a mental health office, but my true passion lies in becoming a multimedia content creator.</p>
    
        <p> This website serves as a journey through my endeavors, showcasing my progress and aspirations in the world of multimedia. I invite you to explore and enjoy your visit as there's plenty to discover and much more on the horizon.

</p>
	<p> My interests span across various creative realms, including web development, illustrations, photo and video editing, and creative writing. Here, you'll get a glimpse of my skills and talents as I strive towards my goals.</p>
