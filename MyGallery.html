	<h1>Multimedia Content Creator</h1>
	<p> As a  multimedia content creator my ideas and projects cross over a wide selection of imagery and audio media formats. Because of that, I have a multimedia portifolio section which you can explore below to get inspirations or even make requests for comissions. Those include, paintings, traditional ilustration, digital ilustration, photoshoop, audio contents and original stories selections.</p>

    <h1> 1.Illustrations </h1>

    <p> Since childhood, my eyes always would bright shine to colors, shapes and lines. Since my very early childhood, I started sketching and drawing. The more I  grew up and became mature the more interested I became in the matter and the faster I realized I coudl be good at it. I was only during the end of high school though and through my preparation for college that I started investing more time in drawing and paiting, wiht simple and cheap materials. After I moved to the united stated in 2019 I invested more time and dedication to learn digital ilustration, which is something I am much more confortable doing now. Nowadays, I  ilustrate in both traditional and digital formats with different softwares selections and materilas as well. </p>

    <h2> 1.1 Traditional</h2>
    <img src="images/600px_png_jpg/linaandmarty.jpg" alt="Portraits" width="600px" class="img"/>
    <p> For my traditional style, I mostly use watercolor, gouache, markers and colorpencils to finalize my ilustrations. I like to have at least 3 different selections of pen sizes in oder to draw my artline.</p>

    <h2> 1.2 Digital</h2>
    <img src="images/600px_png_jpg/ilustracao_600px.jpg" alt="phone ilustration" width="600px" class="img" />
    <p> Digital ilustration is one of my biggest pations at the moment, and certainly one I want to learn more and more everyday. It something that not only relaxes me but also makes me feel good about myself. I mostly ilustrate in procreate and now I am starting to explore ilustrator</p>


    <h1> 2 Photoshop and Edits </h1>
    <img src="images/600px_png_jpg/RodrigoCazuza_selfie_600px.jpg" alt="colage" width="600px" class="img"/>
    <p> I always played around with photoshop for personal usages and edits, but during collage I  am finally having the oportunity to explore the wide range of possibilities this softoware can help no only in editing photos but also refining my artwork.</p>
    
    <h1> 3 Oringinal stories</h1>
    <img src="images/600px_png_jpg/Rodrigocazuza_vector_600.png" alt="ilustrator" width="600px" class="img"/>
    <p>Despite my passion for visual arts and applied arts with graphic designs, I also love writting and explore the potential that words can offer. I believe communication is a powerful tool and writting providing me with all the skills I need in order to clearly describe an idea, a thought, a feeling or even better...a whole story</p>
   
    <h2> Short stories</h2>
    <p>I like writting short stories, I  started publishing them in 2019 in portugues and english, I haven't invested much more time on them anymore but the ideas for them keep poping every day. My favorite genre is twisty, spooky or horror stories with existential and even philosophical insights</p>
